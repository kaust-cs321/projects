Project Descriptions

* Self-assembling peptide design

* Assembly Graph Classification

* Predict InterPro annotations

This project aims to accelerate InterProScan protein domain annotation
by developing a deep learning model that combines ESM embeddings,
protein structural information, and graph neural networks. The
integrated approach will leverage multiple protein features to predict
InterPro domains directly from sequences and structures, significantly
reducing computational time while maintaining annotation accuracy.


* Genome-scale protein function prediction

This project aims to enhance genome-scale protein function prediction
by considering proteins within their broader biological context,
incorporating protein-protein interactions, genomic context, and
system-level functional constraints that maintain organism
viability. By using interaction networks, genomic context, and
cellular homeostasis requirements, the model will better capture how
proteins work together to enable accurate functional annotation across
entire genomes.

* Structure-based function prediction

This project aims to improve protein function prediction by developing
novel approaches that better leverage structural information,
particularly for molecular functions like binding sites and catalytic
activities where 3D arrangements are crucial. By designing
structure-aware deep learning architectures that capture precise
spatial patterns and biochemical properties, we aim to achieve
significantly better performance than current structure-based methods
and sequence-only approaches.

* Alignment improvement

This project aims to tackle the challenging problem of aligning highly
repetitive genomic regions, particularly in centromeric and telomeric
sequences where conventional k-mer based methods struggle. Through
systematic evaluation of existing approaches and development of novel
algorithms, we seek to improve the accuracy and efficiency of sequence
alignment in these complex repetitive regions that are crucial for
chromosome stability and function.

* AMR Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning approach for
predicting antimicrobial resistance in Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using a unique dataset of 800 bacterial
genome sequences with their corresponding resistance phenotypes. By
integrating genomic features and resistance patterns, we aim to create
a more accurate prediction model that could help guide antibiotic
treatment decisions and understand resistance mechanisms.

* Metagenomics

This project aims to develop a transformer-based foundation model for
metagenomic data, leveraging Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU)
abundance tables to learn robust microbial community
representations. By pre-training on large-scale metagenomic datasets,
the model will capture complex microbial interactions and community
patterns, enabling downstream applications such as predicting missing
taxonomic abundances and sample-level phenotypes through fine-tuning.

* Chemical classification
- Kanoo extension

* GO Functions, binding, chemicals

* FPDL

This project aims to develop a novel "programming language" for
protein design that leverages Gene Ontology (GO) to specify desired
protein functions, moving beyond current structure-based design
approaches. By creating a formal language based on GO's compositional
logic and a corresponding "compiler" that generates protein sequences,
the system will enable design of individual proteins with novel
function combinations, multi-protein complexes, and
temporally-organized pathways. The project combines theoretical
computer science (establishing completeness properties) with practical
implementation and experimental validation, potentially
revolutionizing how we design proteins with specific functions.


* Prediction of treatment response
This project aims to develop a knowledge-based machine learning
framework for predicting cancer treatment responses by integrating
multi-omics data, population-specific pangenome information, and
biological knowledge bases. Through validation with organoid models
and clinical data, the project seeks to create accurate and
population-aware treatment response predictions that capture both
genomic diversity and established cancer biology mechanisms.
